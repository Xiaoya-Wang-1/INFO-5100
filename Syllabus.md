<p align ="center"><strong> Application Engineering and Development </strong></p>

Takes students in a step-by-step manner through the process of systematically combining UX techniques, business processes, and complex data models to assemble applications that are user-friendly and meet business requirements. 

Employs the object-oriented paradigm, visual user experience, and system design principles to put together complicated, powerful, real-world applications. The primary objective of this course is to practice social-technical software engineering methods and tools to solve real-world problems. 

Offers students an opportunity to learn innovative design and programming techniques to build significant business applications quickly; to practice simple and smart ways of making software construction enjoyable; and to master the art of how to systematically write software programs to solve any business problem.

<p align ="center"><strong> Standard Learning Outcomes </strong></p>

- An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems.
- An ability to explain and apply engineering design principles, as appropriate to the programâ€™s
educational objectives.
- An ability to produce solutions that meet specified end-user needs with consideration of public
health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic
factors. The Information Systems Program accepts students of different engineering
backgrounds with minimum programming skills and produces first-class Information Systems 
engineers that operate at the intersection of real-world complexity, software development, and
IT management. Graduating students will be able to construct end-to-end advanced software
applications that meet business needs.
