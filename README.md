# Application Engineering and Development - Course Repository

## Course Overview
This repository contains projects and assignments for the **Application Engineering and Development** course. The course systematically guides students through the process of combining **UX techniques**, **business processes**, and **complex data models** to build applications that are both user-friendly and meet business requirements.

Students will learn innovative **software programming techniques** that enable quick and efficient application design and development. Through hands-on weekly lab sessions, students practice building applications as an assembly of components. This course introduces **Object-Oriented techniques** for creating business architectures that map directly to software applications, helping to turn vague requirements into systems of ecosystem scale.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Employ **object-oriented programming** principles, **visual user experience** strategies, and **system design** to develop real-world applications.
- Practice **social-technical software engineering** methods and tools to solve real-world business problems.
- Learn innovative design and programming techniques to build business applications quickly.
- Develop skills in **component-based application assembly** and turn vague requirements into scalable systems.
- **Master the art of system design** for complex business problems, particularly for those with and without prior programming experience.

## Tools & Technologies
Throughout this course, various technologies and methodologies are employed to solve business challenges, including but not limited to:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **User Experience (UX) Design**
- **Component-based System Design**
- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**
- **Model/View/Controller (MVC) Architecture**
- **[Additional tools or libraries you are using]**
